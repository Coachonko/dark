# Dark

Dark is UI rendering engine for javascript apps without dependencies and written in Typescript ðŸ’«

## Notice ðŸ™ƒ
This project was written in my free time as a hobby. I challenged myself: can I write something similar to React without third-party dependencies and alone. It took me about 4 years to bring it to an acceptable quality (but this is not accurate). It would probably take you much less time to do it. I rewrote it many times from scratch because I didn't like a lot of it. In the end, I decided to bring it to release, since the "ideal" is still unattainable. In addition, it is necessary to bring the work started to the end. I didn't get to do a lot of what I wanted to do. That is life. You can use the code at your own risk.

## Installation
npm:
```
npm install @dark-engine/core @dark-engine/platform-browser
```
yarn:
```
yarn add @dark-engine/core @dark-engine/platform-browser
```
## API overview
The API is partially similar to the React API and includes 2 packages - core and browser support.

```typescript
import {
  h,
  createComponent,
  createContext,
  Fragment,
  lazy,
  memo,
  forwardRef,
  Suspense,
  useCallback,
  useContext,
  useEffect,
  useError,
  useImperativeHandle,
  useMemo,
  useReducer,
  useRef,
  useState,
  useUpdate,
} from '@dark-engine/core';
import { render, createPortal } from '@dark-engine/platform-browser';
```
## Shut up and show me your code!

For example this is timer component

```typescript
import {
  h,
  createComponent,
  useState,
  useEffect,
  TagVirtualNodeFactory,
} from '@dark-engine/core';
import { render } from '@dark-engine/platform-browser';

type TimerProps = {
  slot?: (value: number) => TagVirtualNodeFactory;
};

const Timer = createComponent<TimerProps>(({ slot }) => {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timerId = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(x => x + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(timerId);
  }, []);

  return slot(seconds);
});

const App = createComponent(() => {
  return [
    <div>Timer component is just logic component without view...</div>,
    <Timer>{(seconds: number) => <div>timer: {seconds}</div>}</Timer>,
  ];
});

render(App(), document.getElementById('root'));
```
