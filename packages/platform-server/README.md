Dark renderer for Node.js.

[More about Dark](https://github.com/atellmer/dark)

A normal Dark application runs in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to user actions. You can also render on the server by creating static application pages that are later loaded on the client. This means that the app typically renders faster, allowing users to preview the layout of the app before it becomes fully interactive.
The basic principle: on the server, the component code is rendered into a string, which the server returns in response to a request in the form of a file to which the assembled build of the front-end code is connected. The user receives a rendered page with content instantly, while Dark performs a hydration process, i.e. reuses DOM nodes already created on the server, hangs event handlers, and also performs all relying effects.

You can also render through Node.js API into html files directly then save them to give away next without hydration. In this case you will get a static site generation.

## Installation

from template:
```
npx degit github:atellmer/dark/templates/server my-app
```

npm:
```
npm install @dark-engine/platform-server
```

yarn:
```
yarn add @dark-engine/platform-server
```

## API

```tsx
import { renderToString, renderToStream } from '@dark-engine/platform-server';
```

## Usage
Suppose you have a directory like this:

```
app/
â”œâ”€ client/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ static/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ build.js
â”‚  â”œâ”€ app.tsx
â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.tsx
â”‚  â”œâ”€ webpack.config.js
â”œâ”€ server/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ app.ts
â”œâ”€ package.json
â”œâ”€ tsconfig.json
```

### Rendering to string

The method renders app to string async to unblock main thread of Node.js

```tsx
// server/app.ts
import { renderToString } from '@dark-engine/platform-server';
import { Page, App } from '../client/app';

server.use(express.static(join(__dirname, '../client/static')));

server.get('*', async (req, res) => {
  const content = Page({ title: 'Awesome App', slot: App() });
  const app = await renderToString(content);
  const page = `<!DOCTYPE html>${app}`;

  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.send(page);
});
```

```tsx
// client/app.tsx
import { h, component } from '@dark-engine/core';

const Page = component(({ title, slot }) => {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{title}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root">{slot}</div>
        <script src="./build.js" defer></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
})

const App = component(() => <div>Hello World</div>);

export { Page, App };
```

```tsx
// client/index.tsx
import { h } from '@dark-engine/core';
import { hydrateRoot } from '@dark-engine/platform-browser';

import { App } from './app';

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);
```

### Rendering to stream

Dark can render to readable streams, i.e. give chunks of data as quickly as possible when starting rendering. This method works better for some Lighthouse metrics.

```tsx
import { renderToStream } from '@dark-engine/platform-server';

server.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const content = Page({ title: 'Awesome App', slot: App() });
  const stream = renderToStream(content);

  res.statusCode = 200;
  stream.pipe(res);
});
```
Please see code examples in the `/examples` directory.

## Lazy modules

Dark is designed to fully support asynchronous lazy code modules during the server-side rendering process. When Dark encounters a lazy module that isnâ€™t yet cached, it halts the rendering process and waits for the module to load and cache before resuming from where it left off. In subsequent renderings, all modules are retrieved from the cache.

This ensures that all lazy modules are fully loaded and the user receives the complete content. If the rendering occurs on the client-side, the lazy module is handled through the Suspense component, which displays a spinner or skeleton screen during loading.
